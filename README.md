Another project I am especially proud of is the Book Search Web Application, which I recently completed as an assignment. I built the application using React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend, focusing on creating a responsive and user-friendly experience. The backend was designed to load and merge data from provided JSON and CSV files using a unique ID field, exposing endpoints for the frontend to fetch the processed data. The React-based interface displays a list of books sorted alphabetically by the author’s name by default, with a fully responsive design for desktop and mobile users.
One of the standout features is the search bar, which allows users to search for books by Title, Author, or Genre, with matching parts of the results highlighted in bold and red. I also implemented a sorting dropdown that dynamically updates the list based on the user’s selection—by Title, Author, or Genre. Styling followed the BEM methodology to maintain clean and modular CSS, while JavaScript was used to ensure seamless functionality. This project allowed me to showcase my skills in full-stack development and responsiveness.
